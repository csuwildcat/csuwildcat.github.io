I have received quite a few feedback responses on the Add-on API Table. A curiously large percentage of the responses were from folks asking me to add support for Opera's new extension APIs. Well I committed to updating this thing, so here you go, Opera extensions APIs are now included ;) The Opera extension API docs were pretty tough to traverse. They are quite verbose and some sections seem like a mixture of a tutorial or article with some method references sprinkled in. I want to make sure I don't short-change any of the browsers on the list, so please let me know if I've missed any APIs. Happy extension development!
