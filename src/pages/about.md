I'm Daniel Buchner, a product designer, software engineer, and open source developer with a passion for building the future of identity, web standards, and distributed systems. This where I share my long-form thoughts on code, technology, Bitcoin, dfand the ever-evolving web.

## My Journey

My career has taken me through some of the most influential technology companies, where I've had the opportunity to work on projects that shape how we interact with the digital world:

**Currently at Gemini** - Working on various products in the cryptocurrency and financial technology space.

**Block (formerly Square)** - As Head of Decentralized Identity, I led initiatives to bring user-sovereign identity solutions to millions of users, focusing on decentralized identity systems and other liberating technologies.

**Microsoft** - During my time at the Redmond giant, I worked on the Edge browser and founded the Decentralized Identity group, which later became what's now known as Entra Verified ID. I was deeply involved in creating standards, protocols, and products for the emerging space of self-sovereign identity and helped establish Microsoft's presence in the decentralized identity space.

**Mozilla** - I led the Developer Ecosystem team and was heavily involved in Web standards development. This is where I got my start in large-scale open source development and browser technologies. I worked on Firefox add-ons, including the Add-on SDK (formerly Jetpack), and developed numerous Web standards in partnership with Google and other vendors, such as Web Components and Web Extensions.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about creating technology that puts users in control of their own data and digital identity. My work in decentralized systems stems from a belief that the internet should be more open, interoperable, and user-centric. Whether it's through Web standards, Bitcoin-related development, or developer tools, I'm always looking for ways to make the web better for everyone.

## Current Focus

These days, you'll find me working on products at Gemini while continuing to contribute to the broader ecosystem of decentralized technologies. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of traditional finance and Bitcoin, and how we can build more secure, user-friendly systems for managing digital assets and identity.

When I'm not coding or designing systems, I enjoy writing about technology, libertarianism, and Bitcoin on X.
